## Project Description

SettleX solves a fundamental problem with group expense sharing: apps like Splitwise only track IOUs — you still have to chase people for real money. SettleX closes the loop by connecting split calculations directly to on-chain payments.

Every payment produces a **real, verifiable transaction hash** on the Stellar blockchain — that hash, checkable on any explorer, is the evidence a payment happened. An on-chain Soroban smart contract additionally records each settlement so participants share one append-only history. Those records are currently *self-attested*: the contract stores what the member submits without checking it against Horizon, so treat the Stellar transaction as the proof and the contract record as bookkeeping (see [Architecture and Limitations](docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md)). The app syncs across all participants in real time — when someone pays, everyone sees it immediately.

**Core design principles:**

- **Non-custodial** — your private key never leaves your wallet extension. SettleX only receives the signed transaction envelope.
- **No intermediary** — money moves peer-to-peer between Stellar wallets; the app never holds funds.
- **On-chain receipts** — every settled share has a Stellar transaction hash you can verify on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).
- **Multi-wallet** — supports Freighter, xBull, Lobstr, and Rabet with install detection. WalletConnect (mobile wallets) is documented as a one-step add in [docs/WALLET_INTEGRATION.md](docs/WALLET_INTEGRATION.md).

## How It Works

```
User connects wallet (Freighter / xBull / Lobstr)
              |
User creates expense, adds members, picks split mode
              |
App calculates each member's exact share
              |
Payer clicks "Pay XLM"
              |
    +---------+-----------+
    |                     |
buildTransaction()    checkIsPaid()     <- on-chain duplicate check (Soroban)
    |
TransactionBuilder constructs Payment operation
  · from:   payer public key
  · to:     payee Stellar address
  · amount: share amount in XLM
  · memo:   expense ID
    |
Wallet extension signs client-side
(private key never leaves the browser)
    |
Signed envelope submitted to Horizon REST API
    |
Stellar validators confirm in ~5 seconds
    |
recordPaymentOnChain() stores to Soroban contract:
  trip_id, expense_id, payer, member, amount, tx_hash
    |
tx hash stored in app, share marked "paid"
useContractEvents polls every 10s -> syncs state for all participants
```

## Smart Contract

SettleX deploys a **Soroban smart contract** on Stellar Testnet as an immutable, tamper-proof ledger of all settled payments.

### Deployed Contracts (Testnet)

| Contract Role | Contract ID | Explorer |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Settlement contract | `CAXVH54JVEUCLDQQW45SMRFTCAAVUGVBT4SBVLAGYDQ2YMAPK6YL6ADI` | [View](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CAXVH54JVEUCLDQQW45SMRFTCAAVUGVBT4SBVLAGYDQ2YMAPK6YL6ADI) |
| Pool contract | `CB4P4EXLGS56IXVNU3PLJO2BHF5BEEPBBYJAHXEPZDSD2OISQIGO53JA` | [View](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CB4P4EXLGS56IXVNU3PLJO2BHF5BEEPBBYJAHXEPZDSD2OISQIGO53JA) |

Network: Stellar Testnet  
Language: Rust (`soroban-sdk` v21.7.6)

### Verified On-Chain Transactions

- Settlement deploy tx: [826092e11281bd8fe3c8997ef0a4886b1bd3728069c6855ec4e3866f0a8f9d06](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/826092e11281bd8fe3c8997ef0a4886b1bd3728069c6855ec4e3866f0a8f9d06)
- Pool deploy tx: [fa245da3ce0a478a9146cccdfa0b1b7f918985c0c138dec3f061f104e5b8f39e](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/fa245da3ce0a478a9146cccdfa0b1b7f918985c0c138dec3f061f104e5b8f39e)
- Pool init tx (`pool_ini`): [a04a0a2f79e06448156b52ebd07060281cab5bee323889e92c584e0aaf50546d](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/a04a0a2f79e06448156b52ebd07060281cab5bee323889e92c584e0aaf50546d)
- Settlement init tx (`stx_ini`): [f05c2f59f980a00e99f3f00d57e22b8b10fd0405064096273fd912c9b05a037e](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/f05c2f59f980a00e99f3f00d57e22b8b10fd0405064096273fd912c9b05a037e)
- Inter-contract settlement proof tx (`record_payment` + internal pool `withdraw`): [04c679c7ab7ec960db505038b4c6ec1f367e5d3caae013696bf3111e493de967](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/04c679c7ab7ec960db505038b4c6ec1f367e5d3caae013696bf3111e493de967)

The final proof transaction above is verifiable evidence of the inter-contract path: settlement `record_payment` triggered pool `withdraw` in the same on-chain execution.

Security hardening note:
- Pool credits are now admin-managed in the pool contract to prevent untrusted self-crediting.
- Pool `withdraw` requires auth from **both** the configured settlement contract and the member. Credits can therefore only be consumed as part of a `record_payment` call — a member cannot drain their own credits directly, and no other contract can spend them. Rotating `set_settlement_contract` immediately revokes the previous contract's ability to withdraw.
- Settlement records now carry an `attested` flag. With no attestor configured a record is **self-attested** — it proves only that a member wrote a string, and the contract verifies neither the `payer`, the `amount`, nor the `tx_hash` against Horizon. Treat the Stellar transaction on the explorer as the evidence, not the in-app record. `set_attestor` makes a verifier's co-signature mandatory and marks records `attested: true`; the verifier service itself is not yet built, so attestor-backed verification is not live in this repo.
- `clear_paid` (admin-only) clears the `ExpensePaid` flag, so a bogus or mistaken record can no longer permanently block the legitimate one. It preserves the original entry in trip history.

> **Redeploy required.** `PaymentRecord` gained a field and `CONTRACT_VERSION` is now `2`. Records written by a v1 deployment cannot be read by this build — deploy fresh contracts and update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID`.

## Project Status & Production Roadmap

**Status: Testnet beta.** SettleX runs entirely on Stellar **Testnet** — no real
funds move yet. Settlement currently uses native **XLM**. USDC settlement,
verified on-chain settlement, broader wallet support, and a Mainnet launch are on
the roadmap. We state exactly where we are rather than overselling.

The complete, honest plan to take SettleX from project to shipped product —
including the known trust gaps and how each one is closed — lives in
**[docs/PRODUCT_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md](docs/PRODUCT_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md)**.

| Area | Today | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network | Stellar Testnet | Mainnet (after a contract audit) |
| Settlement asset | XLM (native) | USDC via Stellar path payments |
| Settlement integrity | On-chain receipt log (tx hash stored; not yet verified in-contract) | Verified / atomic on-chain settlement |
| Wallets | Freighter, xBull, Lobstr, Rabet | + WalletConnect (mobile), passkey smart wallets |
| App shell | Installable PWA, nonce-based CSP | Push notifications, offline reads |
| Identity | Wallet address (client-supplied) | Sign-In-With-Stellar (signed challenge) |

Verified locally with `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test`.

| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| #1   | `InvalidAmount` | Payment amount is zero or negative       |
| #2   | `AlreadyPaid`   | This share was already settled on-chain  |
| #3   | `EmptyId`       | Trip ID or expense ID is an empty string |

### Why a Smart Contract?

In a Horizon-only setup there is no shared source of truth for payment status — any user could mark a share as paid without actually transferring XLM. The Soroban contract solves this:

- `record_payment` stores the real Stellar `tx_hash` as proof of transfer.
- `is_paid` acts as a duplicate guard — re-settling an already-paid share is rejected on-chain with `AlreadyPaid (#2)`.
- All records are permanently on the Stellar ledger and cannot be modified or deleted by anyone, including the app operator.

### Real-Time Events

The contract emits a `pmt_rec` event for every confirmed payment. `hooks/useContractEvents.ts` polls the Soroban RPC every 10 seconds and on browser tab focus. New events are deduplicated by `txHash` and merged into React state — all participants see confirmed payments without refreshing the page.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **npm** v9 or later
- **Freighter Wallet** browser extension — [freighter.app](https://freighter.app)
  - In Freighter: Settings → Network → select **Testnet**
- A funded Stellar Testnet account — get free XLM from [Stellar Friendbot](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnigdhaMandal/SettleX.git
cd SettleX
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a Supabase project

SettleX uses Supabase for real-time cross-user sync. Without it, data only persists locally in the current browser session.

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL Editor, run the full schema from [`supabase-setup.sql`](supabase-setup.sql) (or follow [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for a walkthrough).
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon key** from Project Settings → API.
4. Copy your **JWT Secret** from the same page into `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`. Row Level Security authorizes on a `wallet_address` claim that the app's server signs with this secret — without it, every database call is rejected. See [Wallet Authentication](#wallet-authentication).

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in your Supabase credentials. The contract ID and RPC URL are pre-filled with the deployed testnet values. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your Freighter wallet (set to Testnet).

### 6. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create (or edit) `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
# Stellar Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_EXPLORER=https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet

# Soroban Smart Contract (deployed — no changes needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=CAXVH54JVEUCLDQQW45SMRFTCAAVUGVBT4SBVLAGYDQ2YMAPK6YL6ADI

# Supabase (from Project Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=SettleX
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# ─── Server-only — never prefix these with NEXT_PUBLIC_ ─────────────────────
# Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → JWT Secret.
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-supabase-jwt-secret
# Binds an auth challenge to the wallet it was issued to. Required in
# production and must differ from SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET (the server refuses to
# boot otherwise); falls back to it in dev. Generate: openssl rand -base64 48
AUTH_CHALLENGE_SECRET=
# Optional. Session lifetime in seconds (default 43200 = 12h, max 86400).
AUTH_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS=43200
```

> Variables with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are read client-side and are inlined into the JavaScript bundle — treat every one of them as public. The Supabase anon key is safe to expose because access is governed by Row Level Security.
>
> `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` and `AUTH_CHALLENGE_SECRET` are **not** public. They are read only inside the `/api/auth/*` route handlers. Prefixing either with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` would ship it to every visitor and let anyone mint a token for any wallet.

---

## Wallet Authentication

Your Stellar address is your identity, and the app proves you control it before the database will accept it — a SEP-10 style challenge/response:

1. **Challenge** — `POST /api/auth/challenge` returns a transaction built for your address with **sequence number 0**, carrying a random nonce. Sequence 0 is always below an account's real sequence, so the network can never accept it: it is signable but unsubmittable, and costs no fee.
2. **Sign** — your wallet (Freighter, xBull, Lobstr) signs it locally. Your private key never leaves the extension.
3. **Verify** — `POST /api/auth/verify` checks the signature against the claimed public key and, only on success, mints a short-lived Supabase JWT whose `wallet_address` claim carries the proven address. The token is signed with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, which never reaches the browser.
4. **Authorize** — every RLS policy reads that claim via `public.settlex_wallet()`. Requests without a valid token get no rows at all.

The token is cached in `localStorage` and reused until it expires (12 hours by default), so you sign roughly once a day rather than once per action.

> **Upgrading an existing deployment:** earlier versions authorized on an `x-wallet-address` request header that the browser set itself. Because the anon key is public, anyone could send that header with any address and read or modify every user's data. Re-run [`supabase-setup.sql`](supabase-setup.sql) to replace those policies and set `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`. Until you do, the data layer is effectively unauthenticated.

## Testnet Notes

- This app runs entirely on **Stellar Testnet** — no real funds are used.
- Fund your Freighter testnet wallet with the Friendbot:
  ```
  https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
  ```
- All transactions and contract events are visible at [stellar.expert/explorer/testnet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).
- The deployed contract address and sample transaction on this page can be verified live on the explorer at any time.
